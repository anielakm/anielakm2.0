Hi, I'm Aniela and this is my porfolio website. App is based on Gatsby.js.

## How to open a project?

1.  **Follow this steps:**


    ```sh
    # download files to your folder
    git clone https://github.com/anielakm/anielakm.git
    npm install
    
    # Install Gatsby-cli:
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    
    # Or if you have Gatsby-cli already installed just type:
    gatsby develop
    ```


## Enjoy! 🙋🏻‍♀️
